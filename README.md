Node, MongoDB based Search tool for Kiva [Early Beta]

Pre Requisites
============
You need Node, npm and MongoDB installed and configured.  Currently, the MongoDB ports and security is set as default.  
I will update this section when I add node-config to externalize connection parameters.

Instalation
===========
cd server
npm install
node server.js

It can take upto 2 minutes for the initial database priming.  Once that is done head over to http://localhost:3000/
and lend away.

Stay tuned for updates.

ciao!
